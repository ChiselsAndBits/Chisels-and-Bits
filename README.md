<br>

A **Minecraft** mod that gives you the ability to cut up large <br>
blocks into small bits of whatever shape you can imagine.

Create new blocks from mixing & matching bits of your world!

*Want smoother stairs?* ***Go for it!*** <br>
*Want better looking roofs or pillars?* <br>
**It is all possible now.**

<br>

## Compatibility

### Vanilla

By default, all solid, simple, full cube blocks, like <br>
logs, planks, ores (diamond, emerald, iron etc), <br>
storage blocks are supported.

Additionally, some specific blocks are curated by <br>
hand, this is especially done for all glass blocks.   

<br>

### Mod

The scan for compatible blocks automatically <br>
detects all mod blocks which are compatible.

If a mod maker wants to control the selection <br>
procedure for their blocks, they can do so, by <br>
adding them to either one of two tags:

-   `chiselsandbits:chiselable/forced` to force the <br>
    block to be chisel-able (handy for glass like blocks)

-   `chiselsandbits:chiselable/blocked` to prevent <br>
    a block that is normally chisel-able to be chiseled.

<br>
<br>

## Rebuild

As of the `1st August 2021` this project underwent a <br>
massive rebuild and this means that not all features, <br>
that you as a player know from older versions, <br>
are part of this newly rebuild version.

Additionally, this means that older versions of the <br>
mod are not supported anymore, even if they are <br>
for an active LTS version of Minecraft.

Sadly we do not have the time or energy to <br>
support all the versions we would want.

If you are missing a feature on the new rebuild version, <br>
please open a support ticket, after you have searched <br>
the already existing issues. Thanks.
